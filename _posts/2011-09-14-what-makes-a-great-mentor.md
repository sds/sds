After interning at [Causes][CS] for a few weeks now, I've been asked a couple
of times what I think defines a great mentor. This is a hard question to
answer, because it seems like a good mentor consists of so many qualities
(especially if they're a _great_ one). I've personally had the pleasure of
having some amazing mentors at great companies.  However, when I take the
intersection of all the characteristics of these individuals, I find the
intersection of "winning" traits is surprisingly small.  I've decided to list
what I think those magical qualities are, relating them back to my own personal
experience. I'll also cover some concrete activities you can do to encourage a
great learning experience.

# Patience

The great mentors I've had have always been incredibly patient. People learn at
different paces, and it's easy to forget that a subject you find so easy is
something in which your mentee has no experience, whereas you have plenty. Be
supportive in their learning process, and when they make mistakes, be
constructive rather than critical in pointing them out. Remember that no one
intentionally makes mistakes, and sometimes it simply takes repetition to help
foster the positive patterns you're trying to imbue in your mentee's mind.

In keeping with this, you should strive to encourage an open and friendly
relationship with your mentee. One of the worst things that can happen is for
your mentee to feel like asking you a question is bugging you. Obviously,
there's a fine line here between asking too little or too often, but erring on
the side of too often is better than having a clueless and frustrated mentee. I
personally haven't had a situation where I felt like I was overly imposing when
asking questions, but I can imagine how intimidating it would be if I didn't
have an open channel of communication where ideas and questions could be
bounced around without fear of wasting someone's time.

# Empathy

Before you start calling me sappy, let me be specific: empathy is the
identification (and sometimes sharing) of the feelings, thoughts, or attitudes
of another being. To empathize does not mean you coddle, it means you tailor
your mentoring style to that of your mentee's current mental state. Being aware
of what your mentee might be thinking and customizing your teaching to that
thought process is an infinitely better method of teaching than the standard
same-template-for-all approach. If you sense your mentee is lacking
understanding in a particular topic, don't ask them if they
understand---they'll feel pressured to say yes for fear of making you
explain again, or even worse they'll say yes _thinking_ they understand.
Instead, elaborate more on that particular topic, and ask questions to
encourage your mentee to actually think, rather than absorb. This will let you
catch errors in their understanding and correct them.

Throughout this, remember that your mentee probably feels pressured to perform
and succeed---everyone does. When mentees start comparing their accomplishments
to yours and other experienced employees in the company, a mild to serious case
of [Imposter Syndrome][IS] can occur, as they'll feel like they aren't being a
worthy contributor.

One of the most eye-opening experiences I had while working with a large number
of other interns was revealing to the others that I felt like I wasn't
succeeding or contributing in any meaningful way. Considering these other
interns bright and talented individuals, I was shocked to hear them all reveal
the same feelings: a sense of not living up to expectations, of not being worth
their salt. We're sometimes blind to our own successes, and this can hurt our
confidence in ourselves and our motivation to succeed. Great mentors understand
just how badly their students want to succeed, and do everything in their power
to encourage an intern's success and make them know their contribution is
indeed valuable.

# Wisdom

This is admittedly a difficult quality to describe, as they say the moment you
think you have wisdom, you don't have it at all. When I use the term wisdom, I'm
referring more specifically to experience, not only in the particular field in
which you work, but also with regards to life. Being well-versed in that which
you are trying to teach is pretty important, but raw knowledge about your domain
isn't the only thing you should try to pass on to your mentee.

With years of experience, a mentor should offer advice that is both prescriptive
and practical, ideally something that took them years to learn. You have an
opportunity here to give another person a huge leg up in their career--they
won't forget it when the time comes for them to do the same.

I've personally enjoyed mentors who not only showed me how to be a great
engineer, but also gave me pointers in areas I would never expect. Whether it be
advice on traveling, financial planning, or simply living a balanced life, the
mentors who have offered me knowledge in areas outside the realm of work always
leave the greatest impression.

# Some Practical Advice

While I feel the qualities listed above can describe a good mentor for any
profession, I was originally asked to discuss some concrete things that an
engineer can do to be a great mentor. Listed below are two simple practices that
I think are a great way to facilitate a great learning experience for your
mentee.

## Code Review

[Code Review][CR] is a valuable way for a mentee to get solid feedback on their
work, and also allows you to catch any mistakes they may have made before code
goes into production. If you happen to be working at a company where code
review is the cultural norm, congratulations! You probably already have a
system or tool you can use to give your mentee feedback. If you don't have such
a system, you should instead take the time to sit down with your mentee and go
through the code together.

I've always seen code reviews as an quick way to learn various nuances of the
codebase I'm working in, and the technology stack as well. Especially when it
comes to learning a new language, code review allows me to come up with
something that works, and then receive feedback on the "right" way to do
things.  This also gives a mentor a better sense of where the mentee is at in
their understanding of certain concepts, and they can address any discrepancies
as necessary.

I've always looked forward to having my code reviewed. In fact, I feel slightly
edgy about pushing something that hasn't been reviewed. There's something
comforting about having someone else look at your code and point out some things
that can be changed (however minor), as it leaves you with a feeling of having a
solid set of code in the end.

## Pair Programming

[Pair Programming][PP] is like code review on steroids. You and your mentee sit
down and write a piece of code together, taking turns driving. In your working
together, you can see areas where your mentee needs improvement, and your
mentee can watch and learn from a master through observation.

This is also a great onboarding process, as early on you (the experienced
engineer) do most of the driving and your mentee can observe without worrying
about implementation details for code they are not familiar with. You can take
this time to point out the big picture of your system, and point out any
gotchas that might not be obvious, easing them into the company codebase.

My personal experience with pair programming has been very positive. When being
introduced to a brand new codebase, I feel that when my mentor is driving I'm
able to actually make suggestions and comment on what I see, as I'm not
preoccupied with thinking too much about the implications of the code being
written. It allows me to feel like I'm being productive despite not writing
anything, and I'm still learning the codebase in the process. When I finally get
around to driving, it feels like having someone right next to me makes me more
productive, as I'm reminded that I'm not only consuming my time but another
person's as well. You don't end up getting distracted when you're pairing, which
is a huge win.

# The Right Stuff

At the end of the day, if you're passionate about what you do and want to pass
on your passion and knowledge to someone else, you're 90% of the way to becoming
a great mentor. The rest is all in how you harness that enthusiasm.

The onus isn't entirely on you, however---having a good mentee is also very
important in fostering a great mentoring relationship. I've seen interns who
misinterpret constructive criticism as just criticism, and it's ugly, as both
the intern and the mentor walk away feeling like failures. Perhaps a discussion
of the qualities of a good mentee are in order for a future post. In any case,
I hope this post gives aspiring mentors out there some food for thought.
Remember that you're a big reason why interns want to be an intern, and I think
I speak for all aspiring young software engineers when I say "thank you" for
your efforts.
