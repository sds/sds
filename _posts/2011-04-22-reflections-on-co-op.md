Being a student at the University of Waterloo has had a profound effect on my
career as a student, and even more so as a software engineer. In a world where
post-secondary degrees are seen by many as a necessary expense for a
successful---in the eyes of many, simply a well-paying---career, it's sometimes
hard to justify what actually makes a school "good" other than its ability take
your money and award you a degree. Having almost finished my fifth internship,
I've had a moment to reflect on my experiences with Waterloo's co-op program,
and what about the system makes it great.

In a nutshell, Waterloo's greatest asset to students is its focus on cooperative
education (i.e. internships). Quality of teaching does not get you as far as you
would like to think. My anecdotal evidence for this comes from the fact that
I've had my share of _awful_ professors (to be fair, only two have truly
earned that title), but I don't feel these experiences have had a significantly
detrimental effect on preparing me for my career. The simple fact is if it's
actually important, you will learn the material one way or another, and chances
are you will learn it on the job rather than in the classroom.

# Internships Fill the Gaps Missed by Academia

Internships take the theory of what you learn and apply it to practical
applications. However, that's not their greatest benefit. For me, the greatest
advantage of internships is that I've learned skills that I otherwise would
never have acquired in the academic world.

* How to interview (in other words, how to sell yourself)
* How to communicate ideas effectively (specifically to non-technical people)
* How to be "workplace smart" (understanding corporate politics)

These are unfortunately skills that simply don't get taught in the classroom.
Courses teach you the material to prepare you for later courses, and---the
university hopes---for graduate school. Some universities are recognizing the
need to teach these "soft" skills, but instead of implementing a co-op program,
they include extra courses as part of the curriculum that try to teach these
skills (Waterloo also assigns students course work during their work terms to
supplement their work experience, but it has been met with much
[opposition][PD] from students due to its ineffectiveness); trying to teach
these skills is extremely hard in a classroom setting.

# Internships Yield Networking Opportunities

Were it not for the reputation of Waterloo's co-op program, I doubt I would
have been able to get my foot in the door in some of the companies I've worked
with.  I've met some incredible people at these companies, as I see them not
only as great mentors, but also as valuable connections. Professional
networking has [many uses][PN], but at its core it gives you opportunity, and
more opportunity is always a good thing. Being able to utilize connections to
take advantage of new opportunities down the road gives a greater sense of
flexibility in one's future career path.

# Internships Are Fun

This may seem like a fluffier point, but the reality is that being an intern is
awesome. Most serious software companies understand just how important interns
are. More than just cheap labour, interns are a sampling of the future talent
pool from which a company can hire, and interns each have social networks which
can positively or negatively effect your company's image ([word-of-mouth][WOM]
can be a very effective---or damaging---marketing strategy). The net result of
this is that interns get some pretty awesome perks from those companies who
want them to leave with a positive impression.

# We Learn Through Experience

One crucial idea I've picked up on throughout my experience as a co-op student
is that students seem to learn better from experience than from teaching. A lot
of what we learn in our education tends to be forgotten within a few years
(with some courses, even a few months). Those ideas which manage to stick
around in our minds tend to be those which get revisited, which more often than
not are those skills we apply in the real world. If the [evidence][ROE] is any
hint to us, human beings were built to learn through experience; it's time we
saw some more schools start to embrace that fact.
