# Who am I?

My name is Shane da Silva, and I'm many things, one of them being a software
engineer. I enjoy multiple facets of programming, from the highly theoretical
areas of computer science to the more pragmatic discipline of software
engineering. This blog is an attempt to provide an outlet for my internal
musings on both the useless and the useful, so-to-speak. I might even throw
some philosophy into the mix, who knows.

# What have I built?

In the recent past, I helped launch [Facebook
Places](https://www.facebook.com/facebookplaces), built and demoed a
proof-of-concept that kicked off the [Mozilla Push
Notifications](http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/02/mozilla-developing-web-push-notification-system-for-firefox.ars)
project, and helped make philanthropy more efficient by building a platform on
[Causes.com](http://causes.com). Causes was acquired by
[Brigade in 2014](http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/11/sean-parkers-brigade-media-acquires-causes-in-its-quest-to-revitalize-american-democracy/),
so I'm now applying myself to building tools to revitalize democracy.

I also maintain a number of notable open source projects:

* [Overcommit](https://github.com/brigade/overcommit)
* [SCSS-Lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint)
* [HAML-Lint](https://github.com/brigade/haml-lint)
* [Slim-Lint](https://github.com/brigade/slim-lint)

# What's my background?

I graduated in 2012 with an Honours Bachelor of Software Engineering (with
Distinction) from the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca). My
specific interests are all over the map, but I'm currently fascinated with
building large scale systems that are "magic." I consider a system magical when
it "just works." A system that is functional, robust, self-healing, and still
manages to be useful is hard to find, but a challenge to work on.

# Random

The original name for my blog was "Coding by the Woods". Why? My last name
comes from the Latin word for forest, and so it is believed that my ancestors
may have taken the name because they [lived by a
forest](http://thesilvafamily.wordpress.com/2008/01/25/concerning-the-origin-of-the-da-silva-surname/)
(exciting, I know).
